# Landing Page & Design Update

## Overview
The frontend has been completely redesigned with a modern, professional landing page and a fresh color scheme that moves away from the traditional blue palette.

## 🎨 New Color Scheme

### Primary Colors
- **Emerald/Teal**: Main brand colors (emerald-500 to teal-600)
- **Amber/Orange**: Accent colors for CTAs and highlights
- **Slate**: Neutral backgrounds and text
- **Purple/Pink**: Feature highlights
- **Cyan**: Additional accents

### Why These Colors?
- **Professional & Fresh**: Emerald and teal convey trust, growth, and efficiency
